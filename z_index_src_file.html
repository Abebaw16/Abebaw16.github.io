				<h2>Neil Armstrong</h2>
		<p>
		Neil Armstrong stepped into history on July 20, 1969, leaving the first human footprint on the surface of the moon. 
		"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind," Armstrong is famously quoted as saying after walking on 
		the moon, but in interviews he claimed that he meant to say "one small step for a man."
		</p>
		<p>
		Armstrong died in 2012 at age 82 following complications resulting from cardiovascular procedures.</p>

		<p>
		Mitchell died at 85, in Florida, in early 2016. After NASA, Mitchell devoted his life to exploring the mind, physics 
		and unexplained phenomena such as psychics and aliens. Shepard died in 1988. Before walking on the moon, Shepard became 
		the first American in space with a suborbital flight in 1961.</p>
